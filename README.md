I have a Lego collection and want to sync my Lego pieces with the Rebrickable website using its APIs. I also want to develop an online iOS app that connects to the Rebrickable API, with no need for App Store deployment. The app will organize LEGO pieces into labeled boxes stored in drawers, with each box and drawer having a QR code for scanning to add or remove pieces. The app will connect to the Rebrickable database to check required pieces for a set and display which drawers and boxes contain the necessary pieces to build a set. The app will import Lego pieces data from the Rebrickable API into my local SQLite database.
